         <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
         <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
            elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
               Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
               on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
               a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
               provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
               manipulations on a server.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
               page about JavaScript.</li>
         </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
         <header>Hello World</header>
         <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
            code:</p>
         <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
         <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
         <header>Declaring Variables</header>
         <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
         <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
         <code>var x = 42.</code>
         <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
         <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
         <code>x = 42.</code>
         <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.</p>
         <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
         <code> let y = 13.</code>
         <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
         <header>Variable Scope</header>
         <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
            to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
            local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
         <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a
            block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
            code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not
            the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
         <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
         <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
         <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined</code>
